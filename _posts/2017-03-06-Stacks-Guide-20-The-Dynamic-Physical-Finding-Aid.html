title: Stacks Guide 2.0&#58; The Dynamic Physical Finding Aid
---
<p>In the last iteration of the Kansas State University Libraries website, the library catalog was integrated with an image map as a clever, helpful tool to aid patrons in locating an item on the shelf. Now, in the latest version of the website, Stacks Guide has been updated with new technologies to make it responsive and even more interactive, without having to rely on image maps. The poster will describe these changes, contrasting the old Stacks Guide with the new as a study in incremental technological upgrade of web technology.</p>
